    <h1>Week 2 Assignment - Part 1</h1>
    <p>Question 1 : Everytime we create a variables, do we need to create a consol.log for it or is it just a way for us to keep it organize. 
      For example, if i created a variable (let name = my 'name';), do I need to create a consol.log saying "my name is" + variable.
